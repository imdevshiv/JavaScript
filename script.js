 *
 *      CSR(Client side Rendering):-is a technique where the browser is responsible for rendering the content.
 *                                  When a user visits a website, the server sends minimal HTML along with JavaScript files,
 *                                  which the browser then executes to dynamically build the page content.
 *
 *      SSR(Server Side Rendering):-is a technique used to render web pages on the server instead of in the browser.
 *                                   When a user requests a page, the server generates the complete HTML for that page
 *                                     and sends it to the browser.
